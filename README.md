# Hey there 👋 I'm Sungkar!

I'm a curious and enthusiastic Computer Sciences & Mathematics student at UW–Madison (class of 2026), passionate about building things that work fast, scale well, and make people go “whoa, that’s neat.”

I love diving into systems programming, messing with C and C#, and occasionally wandering into the world of ML and web dev when I feel like it 🌱

## 🧰 Tech I Enjoy Working With

- **Languages**: C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, R  
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Git, .NET, React, Node.js, Svelte, ROS 2, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- **Other favorites**: threading, system calls, DAGs, and that sweet moment when your code compiles on the first try 💻

## 🛠️ Cool Projects

🧵 **Minispark** — A baby version of Apache Spark written in C. Handles parallel data processing with thread-safe magic.  
🏦 **Banking System** — Modular and secure, with C# and .NET — using design patterns like Singleton, Strategy, and Factory.  
🌀 **WSH** — A Unix shell I built from scratch for an OS course, with piping, redirection, and all the good stuff.  
🚀 **Mars Rover Navigation** — Leading a subteam at Wisconsin Robotics, writing ROS 2 nodes and CV pipelines to help a robot drive on Mars (okay, not Mars *yet*, but soon 👀)

## 👨‍🏫 Giving Back

Currently mentoring CS 537 students (Intro to Operating Systems) and loving the opportunity to help others debug, learn, and feel confident in their code.
